1. Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a0-a7; a2;

2. Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: There is none. g(x) is inlined within f(x) and f(x) is further inlined into main().

3. Q: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x0000000000000628, main calls it with pc-relative addressing.

4. Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x0000000000000038, next line of assembly right after the jalr.
